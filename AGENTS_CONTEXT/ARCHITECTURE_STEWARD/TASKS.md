### ENFORCE-DURABLE-COMPLETION-GATE-2026-09-28
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** P0
- **Purpose:** Fix the observed divergence between chat-reported Stage-E L2 owner completion and durable repository completion state.
- **Result:** Added the central Durable Completion Gate, strengthened the Session Result Contract and subagent handoff, corrected the Stage-E L2 packet, classified owner-reported-but-unverified work explicitly, and prevented repeat-work loops.
- **Receipt:** `RESULTS/STEWARD-20260928-DURABLE-COMPLETION-GATE.md`
- **Completion commit:** `d1f885e186ccf0c75ed9a8b35d4adefccdc87946`
- **Next:** Pending L2 owners must verify/repair durable completion before the Steward reconciles L2.

## Open tasks

### LOCAL-AGENT-M0-M1-UPGRADE-2026-09-28
- **Status:** ACTIVE — WAVE 1 RECONCILED / CORRIDOR M0M1-CORRIDOR-01 COMMITTED
- **Priority:** P0
- **Prompt:** `docs/agent-system/LOCAL-AGENT-M0-M1-UPGRADE-PROMPT-2026-09-28.md` (design tip `24e5b88e`, read-only; baseline `e1818205` == current main HEAD)
- **Mode/surface:** session DELIBERATE synthesis + bounded EXECUTION corridor (steward-side, central control-plane only)
- **Wave 1 (4/4 CFA INVESTIGATED, verified vs repo):** CFA-10 runtime ledger (depth+per-tool MECHANICAL-provisional; exact-agent/allowlist/paths/schema/diff/tests/freshness PROCEDURAL-GAP); CFA-04 authority preconditions P1–P8 + exact-agent REJECT rule + 3 owner questions; CFA-02 minimal data extension (8 optional keys, 3 aliases, ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL + commands REJECTED, 6 vetos); CFA-09 compat envelope (additive-only v1.2, per-class C1–C9 matrix, suspend-tolerate-supersede rollback, 8 corridor falsifiers).
- **Reconciliation decision:** ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL is validator-emitted derived view only, never receipt-authored (CFA-02 owner verdict adopted); v1.2 REQUIRED only for IMPLEMENTED-with-MODE=EXECUTION.
- **Corridor M0M1-CORRIDOR-01 (MODE=EXECUTION, SURFACE=LOCAL, one writer: steward):** contract v1.1→v1.2 amendment + `tools/Validate-Receipt.ps1` (C1–C9, explicit FAIL, PROCEDURAL labels) + STATE.md note. Allowed paths exact; pre-declared tests: validator runs over 4 CFA receipts (C1/C3/C9 PASS, C8 FAIL-expected pre-commit) + post-commit full PASS re-runs.
- **Receipts:** 4 CFA receipts (COMMIT_SHA closed by content commit below); steward receipt `RESULTS/STEWARD-20260928-M0M1-CORRIDOR-01.md`.
- **Next:** Wave-2 D/E (CFA→leaf productive spawn, P2.1 remaining question) + U1 permission-precedence probe before any M1 claim leans on tool-deny; owner answers on CFA-04 questions (IMPLEMENTED proof bar, fallback tolerance, wave expiry).

### FINISH-FULL-LIST-GOAL-2026-09-28
- **Status:** ACTIVE — WAVE 1 RECONCILED
- **Priority:** P0
- **Goal state:** `docs/agent-system/goals/finish-full-list/GOAL.md`
- **Master list:** `docs/agent-system/FULL-INTEGRATION-TASK-LIST.md` (updated every turn, §9 log)
- **W1 result:** 3/3 CFA units verified + committed (S.2, N.3, H.3 DONE). P2.1 CLI probe pending.
- **M0/M1 wave result (2026-09-28):** 4/4 CFA evidence units verified (CFA-02/04/09/10 INVESTIGATED) + M1 validator installed + contract v1.2. Exact-agent verdict: PROCEDURAL-GAP (fallback-checked) — headless `--agent` can never address CFA/worker; chain vehicle is steward→CFA via Task tool (proven W1). P2.1 still DOING (Wave-2 D/E leaf-leg test next).
- **Owner questions queued:** counter-2 contradiction-registry designation; Phase 3 go (after P2/S.3 green); CFA-04 M1 trio (IMPLEMENTED proof bar; Steward fallback tolerance; per-wave expiry).
- **Next:** P2.1 Wave-2 D/E: (D) CFA spawns one leaf on trivial task, verbatim output; (E) headless steward run spawns one CFA via Task tool (+ P2.3 xhigh validation).

### LOCAL-GATEB-READINESS-2026-09-28
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** P0
- **Purpose:** Local OpenCode recovery onto integrated main + Gate B verification.
- **Result:** Checkout is current main da40571f (clean, ff-only from stale local main; sandbox preserved as lineage). Toolchain, 11 agent bindings, spawn direction, and Commons suite (6/6) verified on this tree. No drift.
- **Receipt:** `RESULTS/LOCAL-20260928-GATEB-READINESS.md`

### STAGE-E-L2-BASIS-ADAPTER-CHARACTERIZATION-2026-09-27
- **Status:** DONE — 7/7 OWNER INPUTS RECONCILED
- **Priority:** P0
- **Packet:** `BOUNDARY-DESIGN-SYSTEM/STAGE-E-L2-SOURCE-RUNTIME-BASIS-ADAPTER-PACKET-2026-09-27.md`
- **Participants:** CFA-01, CFA-02, CFA-04, CFA-06, CFA-07, CFA-09, CFA-10; CFA-03 is semantic lead/consumer.
- **Result:** All seven owner-scoped Stage-E L2 adapter characterizations have durable receipts/task closure on current `main`. Central consistency reconciliation accepted the common adapter contract while preserving explicit UNKNOWN/UNRESOLVABLE limitations.
- **Receipt:** `RESULTS/STEWARD-20260928-STAGE-E-L2-7-INPUT-RECONCILIATION.md`
- **Reconciliation commit:** `47ce0d7c6bb4e90309ea4c9c1d11a57f2aa845f8`
- **Decision:** L2 owner characterization gate CLOSED / RECONCILED (7/7). This does not make Stage E READY.
- **Preserved limitations:** CFA-04 runtime immutable policy-source binding UNKNOWN; CFA-01 runtime revision/CID propagation UNKNOWN; CFA-07 logical Composition identity unresolved; CFA-09 universal durable Change identity/revision unresolved; CFA-10 runtime generation binding UNRESOLVABLE and B1 underproven.
- **Next:** Begin one bounded L3 Steward graph-bundle contract/design action. No runtime join implementation or Ω-law change.

### STAGE-E-L3-GRAPH-BUNDLE-CONTRACT-2026-09-28
- **Status:** READY
- **Priority:** P0
- **Purpose:** Define the deterministic Steward graph-bundle projection required by Stage E without creating a second architecture graph.
- **Dependencies:** Stage-E L0 readiness contract; Stage-E L1 DerivedView/freshness contract; Stage-E L2 seven-input reconciliation complete.
- **Write scope:** Architecture Steward central design/control plane only.
- **Required output:** bounded graph-bundle input set, canonical serialization, deterministic digest, lineage/version handling, bounded trace projection, bundle freshness metadata, validation/failure semantics.
- **Hard boundaries:** the bundle is a projection/cache of the existing Steward graph; no semantic meaning is invented centrally; no second graph, K0 expansion, runtime join, B1 mechanism selection or Ω-law change.
- **Completion condition:** an auditable implementation-neutral L3 contract exists with explicit inputs, output shape, digest/lineage rules, freshness interaction and falsifiers; no domain authority is inferred from graph topology.
- **Next action:** execute exactly one bounded L3 graph-bundle contract/design pass, persist a receipt, then stop for the next routed action.


### MASTER-PORTFOLIO-WORKLOAD-2026-09-27
- **Status:** ACTIVE — MASTER ROUTER INSTALLED
- **Priority:** P0
- **Router:** `MASTER-PORTFOLIO-WORKLOAD-ROUTER-2026-09-27.md`
- **Reconciliation:** `MASTER-PORTFOLIO-STATE-RECONCILIATION-2026-09-27.md`
- **Rule:** master register → local roadmap → master workload router → central task state → local task projection. Historical local routers cannot override the master router.
- **Current packages:** WP-E Stage-E readiness; WP-D generic development kernel; WP-A seam closure; WP-B empirical blockers; WP-C bounded design.
- **Next action:** advance the highest-priority enabled package by exactly one bounded action and update durable routing state.


### CFA-05-10-BOUNDARY-GATE-BEFORE-GRAPH-2026-09-27
- **Status:** DONE — WAVE 4 COMPLETE / GRAPH GATE OPEN
- **Priority:** P0
- **Canonical protocol:** `BOUNDARY-DESIGN-SYSTEM/CFA-05-10-BOUNDARY-BASELINE-AND-RECONCILIATION-2026-09-27.md`
- **Canonical router:** `BOUNDARY-DESIGN-SYSTEM/CURRENT-WAVE-ROUTER-2026-09-27.md`
- **Wave 1:** DONE — 6/6 baselines.
- **Wave 2:** DONE — Steward reconciliation + Wave-3 queue.
- **Wave 3:** sequential and receipt-driven: CFA-05 → CFA-06 → CFA-07 → CFA-08 → CFA-09 → CFA-10.
- **CFA-05:** DONE — receipt exists; blob `1ee0aaddc5566b364d5a20b84784d442b1b61899`.
- **CFA-06:** DONE — receipt exists; blob `8aa3f5be83092baa0ab3e40fabd0ced1df47b760`.
- **CFA-07:** DONE — receipt exists; blob `e3cf9f196325afc7eb6b1f7230d5ae3b5488cc71`.
- **CFA-08:** DONE — receipt exists; blob `17626d7586a463ca0bb3fb90108e1b0bff9623eb`.
- **CFA-09:** DONE — receipt exists; blob `53835c665a098a8b56c706f59f9d6431dc1682e3`.
- **CFA-10:** DONE — receipt exists; blob `e420ad08854a47c663077ba7c05e6be1c8a6e40f`.
- **Wave 3:** COMPLETE — all six receipts present on current `main`.
- **Wave 4:** DONE — receipt `BOUNDARY-DESIGN-SYSTEM/WAVE-4-COMPLETION-AUDIT-2026-09-27.md`; Graph Gate OPEN.
- **Next wave:** GRAPH-ATTACHMENT-WAVE-1 — Architecture Graph revalidation → linked implementation projection contract → bounded Source-Code Graph pilot.
- **Stage A:** DONE — receipt `GRAPH-W1-A-REVALIDATION-RECEIPT-2026-09-27.md`; structural revalidation passed, direct local regeneration limitation recorded.
- **Stage B:** DONE — receipt `GRAPH-W1-B-IMPLEMENTATION-PROJECTION-CONTRACT-2026-09-27.md`; commit `05ccd40984f931a057ab40dd2c72f7221a5333d2`.
- **Human workflow:** send exactly one `Next` to Architecture Steward; routing must follow the current Wave Router and must not repeat completed stages.
- **Lineage rule:** graph-stage eligibility is derived from current main plus the required stage receipts; local cached state is subordinate.

### DESIGN-CFA-COLLABORATION-DEVELOPMENT-ACCELERATION-2026-09-27
- **Status:** DONE / CENTRAL DESIGN FROZEN
- **Priority:** P1
- **Purpose:** Establish the shared collaboration + development-acceleration substrate design before any shared implementation, combining decision/evidence coordination with a fast context→experiment→proof→receipt loop.
- **Design set:** `AGENTS_CONTEXT/ARCHITECTURE_STEWARD/DEVELOPMENT-ACCELERATION/`
- **Dependencies:** Reconciled CFA M1 evidence; existing FSSP-1.3, Agent Commons and Boundary Protocol remain the baseline.
- **Write scope:** Steward-owned generic design/control-plane implementation only; no domain-semantic implementation.
- **Next action:** Completed. Ten current CFA M1 evidence packets were reconciled; generic central schemas, implementation packet and CFA adapter contract are now frozen for mechanical implementation.
- **Completion condition:** Met. The central kernel can be implemented without inventing domain meaning, ownership, authority or live-proof semantics; deferred decisions have named CFA owners and explicit extension points.
- **Stop condition:** Preserved as an implementation guard: stop on semantic ownership conflict, Ω-law collision, or hidden domain semantics.

### CROSS-CFA-M1-CONTRACT-EVIDENCE-CLOSURE-2026-09-27
- **Status:** DONE / RECONCILED FOR DOWNSTREAM SELECTION
- **Priority:** P1
- **Purpose:** Coordinate and verify the first bounded CFA-owned M1 contract/evidence tasks identified by the ten independent roadmaps.
- **Dependencies:** Local CFA M1 tasks and their peer-information requests; no new centralized semantic ownership.
- **Write scope:** Steward control plane and central synthesis only; local CFA homes remain owned by their CFAs.
- **Next action:** Completed. All ten local M1 packets were verified and reconciled into the central evidence/dependency view; remaining gaps are named and owner-scoped.
- **Completion condition:** Met for downstream selection. The minimum contracts/evidence are sufficiently characterized to prepare one bounded governed corridor without inventing missing semantics; live proof remains separately gated.
- **Stop condition:** owner decision, Ω-law collision, material ownership dispute, or insufficient evidence.

### IMPLEMENT-CENTRAL-DEVELOPMENT-ACCELERATION-KERNEL-2026-09-27
- **Status:** READY — DESIGN DEPENDENCY RESTORED
- **Priority:** P1
- **Purpose:** Implement the frozen generic Layer-1 development-acceleration kernel without introducing domain semantics.
- **Design:** `DEVELOPMENT-ACCELERATION/CENTRAL-KERNEL-DESIGN-2026-09-27.md`
- **Design recovery receipt:** `RESULTS/STEWARD-20260928-CENTRAL-KERNEL-DESIGN-RECOVERY.md`
- **Implementation packet:** `DEVELOPMENT-ACCELERATION/CENTRAL-KERNEL-IMPLEMENTATION-PACKET-2026-09-27.md`
- **Adapter contract:** `DEVELOPMENT-ACCELERATION/CFA-ADAPTER-CONTRACT-2026-09-27.md`
- **Dependencies:** Reconciled CFA M1 evidence; FSSP-1.3; Agent Commons; Boundary Protocol; Session Result Contract v1.1.
- **Write scope:** Central generic development substrate only.
- **Next action:** Implement the first generic schema/validation slice and its domain-neutral valid/invalid fixtures; do not implement domain adapters yet.
- **Completion condition:** Synthetic domain-neutral acceptance passes without central code knowing CFA semantics; receipts and derived projections are reproducible.
- **Stop condition:** Any requirement to invent domain meaning, authority, identity equivalence, product behavior or Ω-law.

### GRAPH-ATTACHMENT-WAVE-1-2026-09-27
- **Status:** ACTIVE — L2 RECONCILED / L3 ENABLED
- **Priority:** P0
- **Purpose:** Revalidate the existing documentation-first Architecture Graph, freeze the linked implementation-projection contract, and run one bounded Source-Code Graph pilot.
- **Packet:** `BOUNDARY-DESIGN-SYSTEM/GRAPH-ATTACHMENT-WAVE-1-2026-09-27.md`
- **Gate:** Graph Gate OPEN from Wave-4 completion audit.
- **Stage B:** DONE — receipt `GRAPH-W1-B-IMPLEMENTATION-PROJECTION-CONTRACT-2026-09-27.md`; commit `05ccd40984f931a057ab40dd2c72f7221a5333d2`.
- **Stage C:** DONE — receipt `GRAPH-W1-C-SOURCE-CODE-PILOT-RECEIPT-2026-09-27.md`; commit `24ac0bfbc5114d606f02e14308bd484bbdf5bba5`.
- **Stage D:** DONE — receipt `GRAPH-W1-D-PROOF-EVIDENCE-ATTACHMENT-RECEIPT-2026-09-27.md`; commit `3b009ac92a4e312fc73e19d0a5cea3eb1a91d068` (source-identity correction included).
- **Stage E readiness assessment:** DONE / BLOCKED — receipt `BOUNDARY-DESIGN-SYSTEM/GRAPH-W1-E-SELF-KNOWLEDGE-READINESS-ASSESSMENT-RECEIPT-2026-09-27.md`; commit `5eed9ed10a8b1a38a2237de244debd2d37ba06f9`.
- **Stage E runtime joins:** BLOCKED — the separate self-knowledge design/evidence gate is not yet satisfied.
- **Next action:** execute the central L3 graph-bundle contract/design task; runtime joins remain blocked until the full readiness gate passes.
- **Stop condition:** any request to create a second graph, infer semantic authority from code topology, or collapse UNKNOWN into dependency.

### SELECT-GOVERNED-CORRIDOR-AFTER-M1-2026-09-27
- **Status:** WAITING
- **Priority:** P1
- **Purpose:** After M1 closure, choose one narrow consequential corridor for integration/live proof.
- **Dependencies:** M1 evidence closure; central dependency reconciliation.
- **Write scope:** Steward control plane and bounded execution packet.
- **Next action:** Do not start until the M1 completion condition is met.
- **Completion condition:** One corridor is justified by evidence and has named semantic, authority, Work, realization, runtime and evidence owners.
- **Stop condition:** corridor requires unresolved owner policy or unsupported live proof.

### LAUNCH-CFA-STRATEGIC-ROADMAP-ROUND-1-2026-09-27
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** P1
- **Result:** all ten independent CFA strategic roadmap sessions returned durable roadmaps/task updates; see central synthesis and local receipts.
- **Completion:** reconciled 2026-09-27.

### CENTRAL-CFA-STRATEGIC-ROADMAP-SYNTHESIS-2026-09-27
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** P1
- **Result:** `CFA-STRATEGIC-ROADMAP-CENTRAL-2026-09-27.md` populated with ten-roadmap milestone comparison, cross-CFA dependency/intelligence matrices, shared tooling, decision gates, contradictions, inherited-plan reconciliation, central sequencing and the first shared frontier.
- **Completion:** 2026-09-27.

### CFA-DOMAIN-ROADMAP-WAVE-2026-09-27
- **Status:** SUPERSEDED
- **Priority:** P1
- **Reason:** Expanded into the independent Strategic Roadmap Round 1; no second roadmap-generation wave should be run.

### CFA-HOME-UPGRADE-WAVE-RECONCILIATION-2026-09-27
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** P1
- **Result:** historical CFA-05 exception resolved; durable home-upgrade receipt exists and was verified.

### CYCLE-4-LIVE-CHROME-ACCOUNTS-2026-09-27
- **Status:** SUPERSEDED / CANDIDATE
- **Priority:** P1
- **Reason:** valid candidate downstream slice, but not selected before M1 cross-CFA contract/evidence closure.
- **Next:** reconsider only after a governed corridor is justified.

### COMMONS-V0-RUNTIME-2026-09-27
- **Status:** READY / BACKGROUND
- **Priority:** P1
- **Operational owner:** runtime-constitution-core-substrate
- **Source:** `AGENTS_CONTEXT/AGENT-COMMONS/RUNTIME-PLATFORM-WORKSTREAM-2026-09-27.md`
- **Reason:** durable work remains valid but is not the shared Steward frontier.

### COMMONS-IDENTITY-DRILL-2026-09-27
- **Status:** BLOCKED / BACKGROUND
- **Priority:** P1
- **Reason:** remains blocked until a real key-rotation operation exists.

### OWNER-DIGEST-2026-09-27
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Priority:** P1
- **Owner:** architecture-steward
- **Cadence:** weekly derived snapshot.
- **Scope:** receipt verification, pending work, unresolved contradictions, handoff/attention items when computable.
- **Authority:** projection only.
